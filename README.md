Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

The primary goal of this project is to be able to generate graphics primitives (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons) at different locations on the screen with different colors. 

Description 
---
I have 3 images:  
The first I just combined a few rectangles and lines to make a shape. This is my first time using d3, so I started from scratch.

Second was a recreation of the zia sun symbol on the new mexico flag. I wanted to see if I could make something recognizable out of just shapes. I used a circle, polygons for the sun rays, and a rectangle for the background.

Third was a slightly better version of the flag, using paths instead of polygons. I couldn't quite figure out how to make the curves more flat, but I'll keep experimenting with it as I go. I made functions for the rays so they're easy to reposition and resize.
